🚖 Namma Yatri Data Analysis & Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes ride-hailing data from the Namma Yatri app to understand user drop-offs, trip completion trends, and conversion rates. Using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for visualization, the goal was to extract key insights into customer behavior, driver performance, and operational metrics.


🔍 Problem Statement

The Namma Yatri app required deeper insights into user journey drop-offs, trip completion trends, and fare earnings. Understanding why users abandon rides and which areas perform best was crucial for optimizing operations and improving customer experience.


🛠 Solution

SQL Data Exploration: Queried total trips, earnings, driver cancellations, top payment methods, high-demand routes, and conversion rates.

User Drop-off Analysis: Identified a 15-20% drop-off at each step, leading to only 45% trip completion.

Power BI Dashboard: Created a replica of Namma Yatri's official dashboard, displaying KPIs like trip completion rate, fare trends, distance traveled, and area-wise performance.

Key Area Analysis: Found the lowest and highest conversion rates:

Lowest: Anekal (31.67%), C.V. Raman Nagar (32.81%), Doddaballapur (33.33%)

Highest: Chamrajpet (58.47%), Bangalore South (57.89%), Channapatna (53.57%)


📊 Impact

✔️ Identified major user drop-off points to improve conversion rates.

✔️ Helped understand area-wise demand and trip trends for better planning.

✔️ Provided insights into driver performance and customer preferences.
